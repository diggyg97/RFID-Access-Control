# RFID-Access-Control
This is my project for access control using RFID for supply chain management and other areas where access control using tagging is necessary and easy to implement. 

The code is used to store the tags and then, index the tags that are stored by cross-referencing them and returning a value of 'Access Denied' or 'Access Granted'
